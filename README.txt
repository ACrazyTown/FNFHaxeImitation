/*/ ABOUT /*/
if you are reading this good job! 
basically, this entire thing was just to practice in haxeflixel a bit since i want to learn it
my goal was to recreate the FNF Ludum Dare title screen, but I got a tiny tad sidetracked...

This was really fun and I'm probably gonna do something else in HaxeFlixel soon, (and also something FNF related).
